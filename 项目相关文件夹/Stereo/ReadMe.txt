Stereo
------

The easiest way to experiment with the stereo features of Open
Inventor is using the SceneViewer demo program.

All Open Inventor viewer classes (those derived from SoXtViewer)
support the stereo features.

For programs that use one of the Open Inventor viewers, the user
can easily access the stereo features through the right-mouse popup
menu (bringing up the stereo settings dialog box).

Open Inventor supports many types of stereo including OpenGL
"hardware" (quad-buffered) stereo, horizontal and vertical interlaced
stereo images, red/cyan anaglyph stereo images, and more.

The simple example in this directory shows how to set the stereo
type to red/cyan anaglyph stereo and toggle stereo rendering on
and off from an application program.
